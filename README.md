# python-bytecode-interpreter

A Python bytecode interpreter. 

The version of Python used is 2.7.10, which is the default Python on most OS X versions. 
It will help you a whole bunch to refer to a couple of key files in the CPython (reference) implementation of Python: opcode.h and ceval.c. You may even spend most of your time reading ceval.c! This is a kind of victory state, too.
